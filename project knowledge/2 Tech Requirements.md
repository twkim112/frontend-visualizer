## 2. Tech Requirements

- **Primary Framework: Next.js**  
  **Reasoning:** Next.js is chosen for its robust support for Static Site Generation (SSG), which aligns perfectly with the initial phase of developing Frontend Visualizer as a static catalog. It offers excellent performance optimizations out-of-the-box (like image optimization and automatic code splitting), a superior developer experience, and a clear path for future scalability should dynamic features or server-side rendering (SSR) be incorporated later. Its file-system based routing will also simplify the organization of different component pages.

- **Primary Language: TypeScript**  
  **Reasoning:** TypeScript will be used for the entire codebase to leverage static typing. This will enhance code quality, improve maintainability, reduce runtime errors, and provide better autocompletion and refactoring capabilities in IDEs. For a project aiming to catalog and define many distinct elements, the clarity and robustness offered by TypeScript are invaluable.

- **Styling Solution:** *(To be confirmed, but **Tailwind CSS** is highly recommended)*  
  **Reasoning & Recommendation:** While the specific styling solution can be flexible, **Tailwind CSS** is strongly recommended. Its utility-first approach allows for rapid prototyping and styling of diverse visual components directly within the JSX, which is ideal for a visual catalog. It works seamlessly with Next.js and TypeScript.  
  **Alternative:** If not Tailwind CSS, another modern CSS-in-JS solution (like Styled Components or Emotion) or CSS Modules could be used, ensuring styles are scoped and manageable.

- **Version Control: Git**  
  **Reasoning:** Git is the standard for version control, essential for tracking changes, collaboration (if applicable in the future), and managing the project's history. A repository (e.g., on GitHub, GitLab) will be maintained.

- **Package Manager: npm or Yarn**  
  **Reasoning:** Standard JavaScript package managers will be used for managing project dependencies.

- **Code Quality & Formatting:**  
  - **ESLint:** To enforce code style, identify problematic patterns, and maintain consistency.  
  - **Prettier:** For automated code formatting, ensuring a uniform codebase appearance.  
  **Reasoning:** These tools are crucial for maintaining a clean, readable, and error-resistant codebase, especially when working with TypeScript and Next.js.

- **Development Environment:**  
  - **Node.js** (latest LTS version recommended)
