Frontend Visualizer aims to be an intuitive, static web-based catalog designed to empower "vibe coders," designers, and developers who think visually. The core mission is to bridge the often challenging gap between a conceptual visual idea for a user interface (UI) element or effect and its corresponding technical name or classification. Many individuals know what they want a feature to look or feel like but may struggle to find the correct terminology to search for examples, tutorials, or implementations.

This project will serve as a comprehensive visual dictionary, showcasing a wide array of frontend UI components (such as various menu types, buttons, input controls, and containers), interactive visual effects (including CSS transitions, animations, and modern styling trends like glassmorphism), and common interaction patterns. Each item will be presented clearly with an emphasis on its visual appearance, allowing users to browse, discover, and identify elements by sight.

Initially, Frontend Visualizer will be a static showcase built with Next.js and TypeScript, focusing on providing clear visual examples and accurate naming. The ultimate goal is to enable users to quickly recognize and learn the names of the components and effects they envision, thereby facilitating better communication, more efficient research, and a smoother path to bringing their creative web ideas to life. Itâ€™s about connecting the visual "vibe" with concrete frontend knowledge.
