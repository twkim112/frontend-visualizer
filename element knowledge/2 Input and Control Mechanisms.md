B. Input & Control Mechanisms
Input and control mechanisms are the elements through which users interact with an application, providing data, making selections, and triggering actions. Their design significantly impacts usability and data integrity.

1.  **Buttons (Push Button, Action Button):** Fundamental interactive elements clicked or tapped to perform an action, submit data, or trigger an event. Their visual style often indicates priority (e.g., primary vs. secondary).
    * **Primary Action Button:** A button with strong visual emphasis, indicating the main action on a page or in a form.
    * **Secondary Button:** A button with less visual emphasis than a primary button, used for alternative or less critical actions.
    * **Icon Button:** A button represented primarily by an icon instead of text, used for common actions where the icon is universally understood.
    * **Floating Action Button (FAB):** A circular button, often with an icon, that "floats" above the UI and represents a primary or promoted action. Common in Material Design.
    * **Segmented Buttons:** A group of related buttons, often appearing as a single control, where selecting one button may deselect others or represent distinct choices.
    * **Toggle Button:** A button that maintains an on/off or selected/deselected state after being clicked, used to switch a setting or mode.

2.  **Forms (Data Entry Form):** Collections of input fields and controls used to gather structured user information for purposes like registration, login, checkout, surveys, or data entry.

3.  **Text Fields (Input Fields, Input Box, Text Input, Form Field):** Areas where users can type text or numerical data.
    * **Password Field:** A text field that masks the entered characters for security.
    * **Number Input:** A text field specifically designed or constrained for numerical input.
    * **Search Field/Bar (as an input element):** A text input field specifically purposed for entering search queries, often accompanied by a search icon.

4.  **Textarea:** A multi-line input field for users to enter larger blocks of text, such as comments, messages, or descriptions.

5.  **Checkboxes (Check Box):** Allow users to select one or more independent options from a list. Each checkbox represents a binary choice (checked/unchecked).

6.  **Radio Buttons (Option Button):** Allow users to select only one option from a mutually exclusive set. Selecting one radio button in a group automatically deselects any other.

7.  **Sliders (Track Bar, Range Slider):** Allow users to select a value or a range of values by dragging a handle along a track.
    * **Single-Value Slider:** Allows selection of a single value from a continuous or discrete range.
    * **Range Slider:** Allows selection of a range between two values, typically with two handles.

8.  **Pickers (Date Selector, Time Selector, Color Well):** Specialized interfaces designed for selecting specific data types like dates, times, or colors, often presenting a visual aid like a calendar grid, clock face, or color swatches.

9.  **Toggles (Switches, On/Off Switch):** Visual switches, typically with a sliding thumb, used for turning a setting or feature on or off (representing a binary state).

10. **File Uploads (File Input, File Selector):** Controls that enable users to select and upload local files from their device. May include a button trigger, drag-and-drop areas, or file previews.

11. **Dropdowns (Input Context) / Selects (Select Box, Dropdown List, Picker):** Controls that present a list of options from which a user can make a single selection. The list is typically hidden until the control is activated.

12. **Steppers (Number Stepper, Quantity Input):** Controls for incrementing or decrementing a numerical value by a fixed step, usually consisting of an input field displaying the value flanked by "+" and "-" buttons.
