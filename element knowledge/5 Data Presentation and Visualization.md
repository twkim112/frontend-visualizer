E. Data Presentation & Visualization
This category includes elements specifically designed for displaying structured data clearly or representing data sets visually to uncover patterns, trends, and insights.

1.  **Tables (Data Grid, Grid):** Elements that display data in a structured grid of rows and columns, ideal for presenting tabular information. They often include features like sortable columns, filtering, pagination, and distinct headers.

2.  **Charts & Graphs (Graph, Plot, Diagram):** Visual representations of data used to show trends, comparisons, proportions, distributions, or relationships. The choice of chart type depends heavily on the data and the message to convey.
    * **Bar Chart / Column Chart:** Uses rectangular bars (horizontal for Bar, vertical for Column) to compare values across different categories.
    * **Line Chart:** Shows trends over time or continuous data by connecting a series of data points with lines.
    * **Pie Chart:** A circular chart divided into slices to illustrate numerical proportion or percentage of a whole. Best for a few categories.
    * **Donut Chart:** Similar to a pie chart but with a hole in the center, also showing proportions of a whole. The center can be used for additional information.
    * **Scatter Plot:** Displays values for typically two variables for a set of data as a collection of points, used to show correlation or relationships.
    * **Area Chart:** Similar to a line chart, but the area between the axis and the line is filled with color, emphasizing volume or magnitude over time.
    * **Gauge Chart:** A dial or arc showing a single value within a given range, often used for Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
    * **Heat Map:** A graphical representation of data where values in a matrix are represented as colors. Higher values are typically represented by darker/warmer colors.
    * **Treemap:** Visualizes hierarchical data using nested rectangles, where the area of each rectangle is proportional to its value.
    * **Network Graph (Node-Link Diagram):** Represents relationships between entities as nodes (points) connected by links (lines or arrows).
    * **Funnel Chart:** Shows stages in a process (e.g., sales or conversion funnel) with progressive reduction in values at each stage.
    * **Stacked Bar/Column Chart:** A bar or column chart where each bar/column is divided into segments representing parts of a whole for that category.

3.  **Description Lists (Definition List - HTML: `<dl>`):** Display terms and their corresponding descriptions or definitions as key-value pairs. Useful for glossaries, metadata, or product specifications.

4.  **Stats / KPI Displays (Metric Display, Big Numbers):** Prominently display key numerical statistics or Key Performance Indicators, often using large typography, descriptive labels, and optional icons or trend indicators. Commonly found on dashboards.

5.  **Timelines (Event Timeline, Chronology):** Visually represent a sequence of events in chronological order, typically along a line with markers for each event, accompanied by associated information.
