II. Interactive Visual Effects & Animations

B. Dynamic & Scripted Animations (Visual Examples/Concepts)
JavaScript enables more complex, interactive, and data-driven animations, often utilizing dedicated libraries to manage timing, physics, and rendering. The focus for the visualizer will be on showcasing the *visual outcome* or concept.

1.  **Scroll-Triggered Animations (On-Scroll Animations, Scrollmation):** Animations linked to the user's scroll position, revealing or transforming elements as they enter the viewport. Visual examples would show elements fading/sliding in or complex narrative sequences unfolding during scroll.

2.  **Parallax Scrolling (Parallax Effect):** Creates an illusion of depth by moving background and foreground layers at different speeds during scrolling. Visual examples would demonstrate this layered 3D-like effect.

3.  **Microinteractions (UI Animation Details, Subtle Animations):** Small, focused animations providing feedback or enhancing usability in response to user actions or system events. Visual examples would include button state changes, loading indicators within components, or icon animations.

4.  **Particle Effects (Particle System Animation):** Animations using numerous small graphical elements (particles) to create dynamic visuals like smoke, stars, confetti, or abstract patterns. Visual examples would showcase swarms of moving points/shapes.

5.  **SVG Animations (Vector Animation):** Animating Scalable Vector Graphics using CSS or JavaScript. Visual examples would include line drawing effects, morphing shapes, or animated icons/logos.

6.  **Lottie Animations (Bodymovin animations):** Rendering JSON-based vector animations exported from tools like After Effects. Visual examples would showcase smooth, complex, high-quality vector animations.

7.  **JavaScript Animation Libraries (e.g., GSAP, Anime.js, Three.js, Popmotion):** Libraries offering fine-grained control for complex sequences, physics-based motion, and performant animations. The visualizer would conceptually note these as tools for achieving sophisticated UI animations, interactive graphics, and 3D scenes, possibly showing examples of effects typically built with them.

8.  **WebGL Effects (3D Graphics):** Using the Web Graphics Library API to render interactive 2D and 3D graphics within an HTML canvas, enabling high-performance visual effects. Visual examples might show static images or short clips of 3D models or complex interactive graphics.

9.  **HTML5 Canvas Interactions (Dynamic Drawing):** Using the HTML `<canvas>` element and JavaScript to draw graphics dynamically, enabling interactive animations, simple games, or custom data visualizations. Visual examples could show dynamically drawn shapes or simple interactive graphics.
