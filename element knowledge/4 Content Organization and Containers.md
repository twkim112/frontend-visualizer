D. Content Organization & Containers
These elements provide structure, grouping content logically and visually. They range from simple dividers to complex interactive components, helping to establish hierarchy and modularity.

1.  **Cards (Content Card, Module):** Versatile rectangular containers that group related information and actions about a single subject or entity. They often contain a mix of images, titles, text, and buttons, serving as entry points to more detailed information.

2.  **Accordions (Collapsible Panel, Disclosure Widget):** Vertically stacked lists of items (headers) where each item can be expanded to reveal content or collapsed to hide it. They are used to manage information density and implement progressive disclosure.

3.  **Carousels / Content Sliders (Slideshow, Image Rotator):** Components that display a series of content items (like images, cards, or testimonials) sequentially in the same space. Users can typically navigate through items using arrows, dots, or swipe gestures.

4.  **Bento Grids (Bento Box Layout, Grid Dashboard - Layout Context):** A layout organizing content into a grid of distinct, often variably sized, rectangular boxes or sections, resembling a Japanese bento box. This promotes modularity and can create a visually engaging dashboard or feature highlight area.

5.  **Lists (Ordered List (OL), Unordered List (UL), Definition List (DL), List Group):** Fundamental elements for displaying a series of related items, typically in a vertical stack. Lists can be ordered (numbered), unordered (bulleted), or definition lists (term-description pairs), and items can range from simple text to complex components.

6.  **Containers (General - Wrapper, Section, Box, Panel):** Generic elements used for grouping and structuring content or other UI elements, often for layout purposes (e.g., defining page sections, content wells) or applying shared styling. They can be purely logical or visually distinct.

7.  **Dividers (Separator, Horizontal Rule (HR)):** Visual lines or spaces used to separate distinct content groups, UI elements, or list items, helping to improve organization and visual clarity.
