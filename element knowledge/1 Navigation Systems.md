A. Navigation Systems
Navigation systems are paramount for user experience, guiding users through the different sections, pages, or views of a digital product.

1.  **Menu (General):** A fundamental UI element presenting users with a list of choices, typically links or commands, to facilitate movement or access to features within an application or website. Its appearance can vary greatly, from simple text lists to icon grids.

2.  **Hamburger Menu:** An icon composed of three stacked horizontal lines, typically placed in a corner. Upon interaction (click/tap), it expands to reveal a navigation menu, commonly used to conserve space on mobile devices or collapse extensive desktop menus.

3.  **Kebab Menu:** An icon of three vertical dots. It usually indicates a set of less frequently used options or contextual actions related to a specific item or section, opening a small dropdown or popover menu.

4.  **Meatballs Menu:** An icon of three horizontal dots, functionally similar to the Kebab Menu. It indicates more available options or contextual actions, often specific to an individual item.

5.  **Bento Menu:** A grid layout of icons or labeled squares/rectangles, visually resembling a Japanese bento box. Each item in the grid typically represents a distinct application section, feature, or tool, offering quick, iconic access.

6.  **DÃ¶ner Menu:** An icon comprising three horizontal lines of decreasing length. It is typically used to reveal filtering options or controls for lists, galleries, or search results.

7.  **Dropdown Menu (Navigation Context):** A list of navigation links that appears below a trigger element (like a button or text link, often accompanied by a caret icon) when activated. Used for grouping sub-navigation links under a main category.

8.  **Breadcrumbs (Breadcrumb Trail, Path Navigation):** A secondary navigation aid showing the user's current location within the site's hierarchy and the path taken to reach it. Each step in the path is usually a clickable link, allowing easy backtracking.

9.  **Tabs (Tab Navigation, Tab Bar):** Interactive elements, typically styled as physical tabs, allowing users to switch between different content views or sections within the same context without a full page reload. One tab is visually marked as active.

10. **Pagination (Page Controls, Paging):** Mechanisms for navigating through large sets of content (like search results, product catalogs, or articles) that are divided into discrete pages.
    * **Numbered Page Links:** Direct links to specific page numbers.
    * **Next/Previous Buttons:** Buttons to move one page forward or backward.
    * **Load More Button:** Appends more content to the current view when clicked, rather than navigating to a new page.
    * **Infinite Scrolling:** Automatically loads more content as the user scrolls down the page.

11. **Navbars (Navigation Bars, Header Navigation, Footer Navigation, Top Bar, App Bar):** Prominent horizontal bars, typically at the top (header) or bottom (footer) of the viewport. They contain primary navigation links, site branding (logo), and potentially other elements like search fields or action buttons.

12. **Sidebars (Side Navigation, Navigation Drawer, Vertical Nav):** Vertical panels, usually positioned on the left or right of the screen, containing navigation links, menus, or supplementary information. They can be permanently visible or collapsible (often called Navigation Drawers, especially on mobile).

13. **Links (Hyperlink, Anchor):** The fundamental element of hypertext navigation, allowing users to jump between different documents, pages, or sections within a page. Typically represented by underlined or distinctly colored text.
