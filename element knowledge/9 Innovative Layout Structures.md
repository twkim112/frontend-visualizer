III. Advanced Visual Styles, Modern Layouts & Typography

B. Innovative Layout Structures (Visual Representations/Diagrams)
Modern web design often breaks from traditional grids to create more dynamic, engaging, and content-tailored user experiences. The visualizer will aim to show simplified diagrams or mockups of these concepts.

1.  **Asymmetrical Layouts (Broken Grid Layout):** Designs that intentionally avoid symmetrical balance, using uneven distribution of elements and whitespace to create visual interest, direct focus, and establish a dynamic feel.

2.  **Full-Screen Experiences / Hero Sections (Full-Bleed Layout, Immersive Hero):** Layouts that dominate the initial viewport with large-scale images, videos, or interactive elements to create a strong visual impact. Often used on landing pages or for product showcases.

3.  **Split Screen Layouts (Dual Panel Layout):** Divides the screen into two or more distinct vertical or horizontal sections, each typically presenting related but different content, choices, or calls to action. Useful for comparisons or offering distinct user paths.

4.  **Dynamic Grid Layouts (Fluid Grid, Composable Layout, Masonry):** Flexible grid systems that incorporate elements of varying sizes, irregular spacing, or content-driven arrangements (like Masonry, where items pack together like bricks). They move beyond rigid structures to create visual variety.

5.  **Minimalist Layouts (Typographic Layout, Whitespace-Heavy Design):** Emphasizes simplicity, generous negative space (whitespace), and often strong typography, reducing structural and decorative elements to highlight the core content and create an elegant, focused experience.

6.  **Scrollytelling Layouts (Scroll-Driven Narrative):** Designs where the narrative unfolds or content is revealed and transformed sequentially as the user scrolls down the page. The layout and animations are structured to guide the user through a story or a set of information.
